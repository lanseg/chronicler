A telegram bot that helps you to save all valuable data you've found.

This bot extracts data from the message (text, media, web and social network links, etc) and saves it on your local drive.
If the link is a link to some social network post, then the bot will save content of this post too.

Supported sources and social networks:

* Telegram - message content and attachments (testing)
* Twitter - bot will download text, video, images if there was a twitter link in the message
* Youtube - will download a youtube video or playlist if it is publicly available

Not even a beta.
