I will also admit to being a bit biased here because Arch is the problem child among the test VMs I run, the Arch one breaks roughly quarterly in some way that I need to boot recovery media to fix it despite it being a relatively clean install that’s just being updated daily.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Arch has a distinct advantage in that it \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;mostly\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; does not get in your way and \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;mostly\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; is highly unopinionated. The combination of those two aspects means that it’s attractive for people who want a system that just does what they tell it to do. The rolling release aspect is also attractive for those who want the newest software all the time. And it is generally pretty stable despite those aspects, though it’s not perfect.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;On the flip side, Arch is crap as a development environment because there’s no way to get a consistently reproducible system with it, the vocal part of the community has an absurdly strong tendency to deny that any issue is a problem with Arch itself if they have not experienced the problem themselves, and pacman has some seriously questionable design choices (though these are more prominent in other places that use it, such as MSYS2).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Astute observers will notice that I did not mention the Wiki that most other people bring up, and this is because the Arch Wiki is not really tied strictly to Arch itself. Most of the documentation there except for ‘what package to install for this’ is accurate for essentially any systemd-based distribution, and a lot of it is accurate even for non-systemd distributions, so I do not see it as being any specific advantage of Arch.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;",
