The rolling release aspect is also attractive for those who want the newest software all the time. And it is generally pretty stable despite those aspects, though it\u2019s not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, Arch is crap as a development environment because there\u2019s no way to get a consistently reproducible system with it, the vocal part of the community has an absurdly strong tendency to deny that any issue is a problem with Arch itself if they have not experienced the problem themselves, and pacman has some seriously questionable design choices (though these are more prominent in other places that use it, such as MSYS2).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Astute observers will notice that I did not mention the Wiki that most other people bring up, and this is because the Arch Wiki is not really tied strictly to Arch itself. Most of the documentation there except for \u2018what package to install for this\u2019 is accurate for essentially any systemd-based distribution, and a lot of it is accurate even for non-systemd distributions, so I do not see it as being any specific advantage of Arch.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/1hlvz0u/why_would_someone_use_arch_linux/m3q5ejm/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1735128733.0, "author_flair_text": ":gentoo:", "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_1hlvz0u", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/linux", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": "transparent", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1a", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "linux", "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 1, "name": "t1_m46dr9r", "id": "m46dr9r", "parent_id": "t1_m3pity0", "depth": 1, "children": ["m46dr9r"]}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "m3pity0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "Redditperegrino", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1735112189.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_1hlvz0u", "score": 5, "author_fullname": "t2_x4pmz", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "I\u2019m a long time Linux user and used Arch for the first time 2-3 years ago. \n\nPlease forgive my simple response to your question: it\u2019s fun! \n\nIt felt like driving a manual car vs driving an automatic.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_m3pity0", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m a long time Linux user and used Arch for the first time 2-3 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please forgive my simple response to your question: it\u2019s fun! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It felt like driving a manual car vs driving an automatic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": false, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/linux/comments/1hlvz0u/why_would_someone_use_arch_linux/m3pity0/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1735112189.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_1hlvz0u", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/linux", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1a", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "richtext", "total_awards_received": 0, "subreddit": "linux", "author_flair_template_id": "a54a7460-cdf6-11e8-b31c-0e89679a2148", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"after": null, "dist": null, "modhash": "", "geo_filter": "", "children": [{"kind": "more", "data": {"count": 15, "name": "t1_m3pke1p", "id": "m3pke1p", "parent_id": "t1_m3piyi3", "depth": 1, "children": ["m3pke1p"]}}], "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "m3piyi3", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": false, "author": "gaijoan", "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1735112277.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t3_1hlvz0u", "score": 11, "author_fullname": "t2_3axwojjq", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "collapsed": false, "body": "* No pre-installed bloat.\n* User centric rather than \"user friendly\".\n* Rolling release.\n* Wiki is great.\n\nI went straight to Arch when I switched to Linux and have felt no need/want to distro-hop.
